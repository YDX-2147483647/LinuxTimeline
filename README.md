# (Mostly) Linux Distributions Timeline

> Homework for an OS course in 2022 August.

`chinese.svg` (see releases) is a SVG focused on Chinese distributions.

Not all OS’s on SVG are Chinese, and not all Chinese OS’s are included. Besides, you may find some OS’s on the SVG are not Linux at all.

Most nodes' colors are generated by [Random Color Generator](https://randomcolorgenerator.net/).

The following is roughly the original Read Me.

### Installation

If you want to build your own version, make sure you have gnuclad
installed.

> An alternative method to install gnuclad:
>
> First, download [Release 0.2.4.p1 · FabioLolix/gnuclad (github.com)](https://github.com/FabioLolix/gnuclad/releases/tag/0.2.4.p1).
> 
> ```shell
> $ unzip gnuclad-0.2.4.p1.zip
> gnuclad-0.2.4.p1 $ yum install gcc gcc-c++ automake # maybe redundant
> gnuclad-0.2.4.p1 $ ./configure
> gnuclad-0.2.4.p1 $ make
> gnuclad-0.2.4.p1 $ sudo make install
> ```

To install gnuclad, you can download the source at https://launchpad.net/gnuclad

For Arch users, use the AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gnuclad/

After you have installed gnuclad, to build just the svg, run:

    gnuclad ldt.csv SVG ldt.conf

You can run the script `build.sh` to build the svg, png, and the tarball
containing the source, ImageMagick is required to convert from svg to png.
